The character sets for these fonts are as follows:

Christmas Lights Indoor...
(Includes limited int'l letters, ÄÅÇÑÖäåçñö)

Letters [Bulb Up] are Upper Case Letters
Letters [Bulb Dn] are Lower Case Letters
Numbers [Bulb Up] are 0 thru 9
Numbers [Bulb Dn] are alt0180 thru alt0189
Fill Character [Bulb Up] is alt0150
Fill Character [Bulb Dn] is alt0151
! [Bulb Up] is !     [Bulb Dn] is alt0161
@ [Bulb Up] is @     [Bulb Dn] is #
$ [Bulb Up] is $     [Bulb Dn] is \
% [Bulb Up] is %     [Bulb Dn] is alt0137

Female Plug: Left is [     Right is ]
Connected Male/Female Plug is `

Christmas Lights Outdoor...
(Same as Indoor except as follows)

All characters, both Bulb Up and Bulb Dn, are tilted either left or
right a few degrees as though blown by the wind. Therefore there are
4 "fill" characters instead of 2. They are:
Fill Character [Bulb Up - Left Tilt] is alt0150
Fill Character [Bulb Up - Right Tilt] is alt0151
Fill Character [Bulb Dn - Left Tilt] is alt0152
Fill Character [Bulb Dn - Right Tilt] is alt0153

Vertical positioning and glyph width are the same in both fonts so
that one string of characters can be made by mixing both fonts, 
resulting in an unbroken string of both straight and tilted lights.

Fill characters can be typed in different colors and then the bulb
characters superimposed on top of the fill to created a colorful
holiday message.

This pair of fonts was created for Ole at FontFreak.com as a thanks
for offering to host my site.
